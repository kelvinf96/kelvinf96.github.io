                    <p>"Having tried many times over the years to learn to play guitar to no avail, I began lessons with Declan 18 months ago and cannot believe how well I am doing. Declan is an exceptional teacher, I have advanced more than I could have ever imagined . He is so patient and encouraging and makes the lessons fun. He has taught me everything - from picking notes to different playing techniques . I have learned so many songs and he is focused on teaching you what you want to learn. He explains the theory so well and makes it easy and interesting . I started on Acoustic guitar and have now bought an Electric one. He has taught me the importance of learning scales and practicing daily. He is a very skilled player and loves what he’s does. I would recommend Declan as a teacher to anyone who wants to learn from scratch or improve their skills. I look forward each week to the lessons and am delighted with the results."
